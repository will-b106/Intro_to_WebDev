# Introduction to Web Development

---

## Welcome!
To give this project some background, I made this website for my Enrichment class. 
At my sixth form, UTC, I run an Enrichment Session on Website Development. This session consists of helping students learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that they can create their own projects to put on a portfolio. 
This is why some of the text on this website may be a bit confusing. (e.g. referencing an 'Classroom' on the JavaScript page.)
